# Justice League Music Mixer

## Project Description
Justice League Music Mixer is an interactive web-based music experience that allows users to mix and layer different instrumental tracks associated with Justice League characters. Each character represents a unique instrument or sound layer, and users can activate, combine, and control these layers to create a custom musical mix.

The project focuses on user interaction, audio playback control, and visual feedback through a themed interface inspired by the Justice League universe. The goal is to create an engaging, playful experience that blends sound design with intuitive UI interactions.
